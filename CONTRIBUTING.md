* Describe your commits clearly. We aren't going to restrict you to a particular type of commit message, but make the commit title more helpful than "uh I changed stuff ig" or "uh I fixed things lol"
* If you need to be more descriptive, use the extended descriptions to describe your changes. This would be especially helpful with new features to explain with how they work.
