# Contributing to StopMalwareContent

Thank you for your interest in contributing to StopMalwareContent. We appreciate your effort.

If you're ready to go, follow these instructions:

- Fork this repository.
- Create a new branch in your fork and base it off of `main`.
- Clone your fork onto your local machine.
- [Install Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and configure it to automatically format the document on save. See ![Format on Save option in VS Code](https://github.com/StopMalwareContent/Extension/assets/43351072/05b6d725-f533-49df-aec2-4370a4e76ed9) if you need help finding the option.
- Switch to the new branch.
- Install web-ext to debug your changes in Firefox.
- Make changes to your branch.
- Check if everything is okay by running `web-ext lint`.
- Run extension using `web-ext run`.
- If it runs correctly and as expected, commit to your fork, then make a PR in this repository. Make sure the correct branches are selected, else we will close your pull request.
- Wait for review by project maintainers and follow their comments to fix any issues. Otherwise, if approved, your pull request will be merged when the time is right!

To keep things neat and tidy for us, we recommend you follow these guidelines when contributing to ensure clear and effective communication between you and maintainers.

- Ensure your changes are done in a separate branch in your fork.
- Describe your commits clearly. We aren't going to restrict you to a particular type of commit message, but make the commit title more helpful than "uh I changed stuff ig" or "uh I fixed things lol"
- If you need to be more descriptive, use the extended descriptions to describe your changes. This would be especially helpful with new features to explain with how they work.
- It's ok to ask for help! Not everyone is a perfect human being and collaborative effort is best!.
- If you wish to offer feedback, be constructive. Pointless, negative discussions will get us absolutely nowhere.
